🔔 **SMS Based LPG Gas Leakage Detection using Arduino UNO and GSM**

This project is a safety-focused system designed to detect LPG gas leaks in domestic kitchens or industrial environments using the MQ-2 gas sensor. When a gas leak is detected, the system automatically sends an SMS alert to a predefined phone number using a GSM module.

**🔧 Technologies Used**

_Arduino UNO

MQ-2 Gas Sensor

GSM Module (SIM800L / SIM900)

Buzzer (optional for local alert)

LCD (optional for display)

5V regulated power supply_

**🚀 Features**

Real-time LPG gas detection

Automatic SMS alert on leakage

Customizable phone number via code

Low power consumption

Portable and easy to install

**📲 How It Works**

MQ-2 continuously monitors gas levels.

If gas concentration crosses a safe threshold, a high signal is sent to the Arduino.

Arduino triggers the GSM module to send an SMS alert to the authorized contact.

Optional: A buzzer can be triggered for immediate sound alert.

**🛠️ Applications**

Home kitchen safety

Hotels and restaurants

Gas-powered vehicle service areas
Small-scale industries using LPG
